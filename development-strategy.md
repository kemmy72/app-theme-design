Week 2
Learn to organize your progress with issues and a project board:

set up your repository and clone it
write a development strategy
set up a project board on your repo
create one issue per step, move them to the board
for each step
move that issue into in progress
create a new branch locally
write your new code on that branch
push the branch to your repository
create a PR linked to this issue
move the issue to ready for review
merge the PR, closing this step's issue
move the issue into done
pull the new master branch to your computer
continue to the next step

Lesson Plan
during class

Before Break

This week you will build another group repository, this time learning how to use issues, labels and project boards to track your progress like in the from-strategy-to-issues repository (with all steps assigned to yourself).

By break time you should each have finished to step 4.4 in the week description, you should have:

(GitHub) A repository with:
One labeled issue per step in your development strategy
One project board with a full Ready for Review column
Branch per step in the strategy
(your computer) A clone of your repository with:
A development strategy (a starter file)
A main readme
One branch per group member with an introduction file
After Break

Pull Requests and Merging! In the second half of class you will practice creating and merging pull requests on GitHub, as well as linking issues to PRs and using the project boards.

For each branch on GitHub you will:

create a new pull request
link the PR to it's issue
Review and merge the code, closing the linked issue
Move the closed issue to done in your project board
By the end of class you should have a repository that resembles the from-strategy-to-issues example (with all steps assigned to yourself).

Project
after class

This week's project is to study the app-theme tutorial from Traversy Media.

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough! You are expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository on your GitHub account generated from this starter template. Your repository should be named app-theme and should be cleanly developed with one branch per step. It's up to you to write the development strategy!

A good strategy to for completing this project is the three-step:

follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.
look over your finished code and break it down into steps, write your development strategy.
study the tutorial a second time, following your strategy to build your repository one branch at a time
You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, your development strategy, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:
